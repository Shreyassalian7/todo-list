🎓 Why I Built This

This project was inspired by a machine coding round I encountered during one of my interviews. To help other developers preparing for similar interviews, I decided to recreate the challenge, build it properly using React best practices, and share the complete source code here. I hope it serves as a useful reference and a learning resource for anyone looking to improve their frontend skills.
